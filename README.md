This is an Internship project that I had been tasked to do by the Ministry of Tourism and Culture. 

It is an personnel information system for which I have implemented both the front end and the back end in about a few weeks so I know there are some bad practices in there.

I have used Xampp to run it locally and you can find the database schema(and maybe some entries) in the file "staj.sql".

Here are some screenshots:
